		//Therefore as an immutable object, birds can't be neither modified
		//nor be added any items (fixed size) because of the following possible reasons:

		//birds.add(new Bird());//Compilation Error because it can't add
		//Bird to a possible List<Sparrow> or a List of some subclass
		
//		birds.add(new Sparrow());//Compilation Error always because
		//we can't add a Sparrow to a List<Bird> !
		
		//From Javaâ€™s point of view, both scenarios 
		//(List<Bird> and List<Sparrow>) are equally possible 
		//so neither is allowed.
		
		//Whereas we can specify the content of the list in the declaration
		List<? extends Bird> birds2 = new ArrayList<Bird>(
